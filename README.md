## Requirements

Produce a demo for interacting with an input form to pull data from the Spotify Search API.

## Technologies

Makes most sense to use node.js for backend and React for the backend because:
 - Uses same language for both
 - If I deploy to a server, the solution is the easiest for the user to use as just browse to the web page. No installation required.

## Initial development strategy

 1. Scope out existing solutions available online for inspiration.
 1. Decide early on which Spotify authentication approach to use.
 1. Get the structure of the app in place.
 1. Start TDD development.
